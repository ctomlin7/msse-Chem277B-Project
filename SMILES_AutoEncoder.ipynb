    "to its canonical version. The model is trained on 135M molecules from Pubchem and ZINC12 datasets.\n",
    "The architecture of the translation model and latent dimension of 512 is similar to the one used in Winter et al.\n",
    "In order to make the learnt representations more meaningful, we also jointly trained a regression model to predict some\n",
    "molecular properties that can be calculated using the molecular structure. The regression model uses two fully connected layers\n",
    "with dimensions 512 and 128 and ReLU non-linearity. The properties that are predicted are: logP, molar refractivity, number\n",
    "of valence electrons, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, Balaban’s J value, topological polar surface area, drug\n",
